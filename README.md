URL Handling for simpletons. 

# the gist of it 
Instead of writing an if-else tree of doom (cool band name) or a texas-sized switch statement 
to handle various links the user may click on in your app, exitpath lets you define a rule and 
corresponding closure to call when proper conditions have been met.
